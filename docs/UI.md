# Key Principles:

```
Parent containers: Set explicit dimensions (width: 300px, height: 100vh)
Child wrappers: Use width: 100%, height: 100% to fill parent
Internal layout: Use flexbox/grid properties (flex: 1, grid-area)
Responsive: Use min-width, max-width, clamp() for bounds
This creates a clean hierarchy where each level has clear responsibilities.
```
